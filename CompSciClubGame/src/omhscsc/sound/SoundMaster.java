	 * Ways to play a sound: SoundMaster.play(Sound s); Sound.EXAMPLE.play();

	 * If anyone wants to improve this class, they can do that by finding a way
	 * to get the Data *inside* a clip and storing that, instead of the clip
	 * itself. I think that if the clip data is stored in memory, maybe we can
	 * make a new class that can read and play the data. This means that the

	 * simultaneously read from multiple sources (good, I think).
