 * A world region is self explanatory. It is a region (a rectangle) of a world. The world is not included in the region, rather the region
 * is owned by the world. WorldRegions listen for different actions, such as entity enter, entity leave, entity jump, entity hurt, etc. 
 * 
 * This class will be able to be used to create safe zones, death zones, teleporters, world exits, and more.
